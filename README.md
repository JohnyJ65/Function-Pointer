Function Pointer Calculator

Overview
This project is a simple C++ calculator that demonstrates how to use function pointers and std::function to select arithmetic operations at runtime. The user enters two integers and an operator, and the program chooses the correct function to perform the calculation.

Features

Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

Uses a function pointer selector to map operators to functions

Uses std::function to call the selected operation

Includes helper functions for reading integers and characters

How It Works
The program defines four arithmetic functions: add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
Two input functions read an integer and a character from the user.
A selector function named retel returns a pointer to the correct arithmetic function based on the operator entered.
The calculate function uses std::function to call the selected operation.
The main function reads input, selects the correct function, performs the calculation, and prints the result.


Compilation
Compile with g++:
g++ main.cpp -o calculator
./calculator

Notes

Division uses integer division.

No error handling is included for division by zero.

This project is intended as a learning example for function pointers and std::function.
